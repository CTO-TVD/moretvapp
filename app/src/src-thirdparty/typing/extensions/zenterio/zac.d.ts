            * preparing the device for media recording. This function will automatically perform all steps of the formatting process including:
            *   - Unmounting the device from the operating system
            *   - Basic preparation of medium
            *   - Partitioning, making the data storage device visible to the operating system.
            *   - Generating new file system
            *   - Mounting the newly formatted device
            *
            * Warning: The formatting process will permanently erase any existing information from the device or partition.
            * Beware that the operation cannot be undone.
            *
            * Formatting a physical storage device
            * Any currently mounted file systems on all partitions of the device will be automatically unmounted. All existing partitions
            * will be removed. One or more new partitions will be created and a new file system will be generated for each new partition.
            * Finally, the file systems of all new partitions will be automatically mounted.
            *
            * Formatting an existing partition
            * Any currently mounted file systems on the partitions will be automatically unmounted. A new file system will be generated,
            * overwriting any previous file system. Finally, the file system of the partition will be automatically mounted.
            *
            * Asynchronous
            * The formatting process takes some time, and will be performed asynchronously in the background. During this process,
            * one or more jszacStorageEvent will be fired.
            *
            * Precondition

            * Note: This operation is not supported for remote network file storages
            * Even if the formatting is successful, there might be physical limitations of the device itself that prevents it for being used for media recording.
            *
            * Parameters label	The label of the new file system. The maximum length of the label is limited to 15 characters because of file system limitations.
