             * Netflix requires its own state handling, since it has an additional state
             * (SUSPENDED), which is not supported by the internal AppManager of jsZAC.
             * These states exists for Netflix:
             *
             * Not Running - The Netflix app has not loaded any resources and is not
             *               visible to users. Starting Netflix from this state takes the
             *               longest amount of time.
             *
             * Suspended   - The Netflix app has sufficient access to system resources to
             *               perform minimal "housekeeping" tasks like periodic updates
             *               to the UI, recommendations, and error handling. It does not
             *               hold graphics or video memory. The Javascript UI loaded, but
             *               is not drawn onto the screen.
             *
             * Background  - Background mode is not yet supported by the Netflix
             *               integration. More information can be found in the Netflix
             *               documentation (see link below).
             *
             * Foreground  - The Netflix application is running normally and the UI or
             *               playback is visible to the user.
             *
             * Please note that state Background is not integrated here. More information

             *
             * DIAL_STOP            - Terminated by DIAL 'stop' command
             *
             * LOW_RESOURCE         - Terminated due to low memory. Used internally when starting some
             *                        other app with netflix as one of the disposable apps.
             *                        Can also be used manually by the UI to stop Netflix when starting another app.
             *
             * LOW_POWER_STANDBY    - Netflix is hidden when the user presses the power button and the TV goes into low power standby
             *
             * SCREENSAVER          - Netflix loses visibility because of a screensaver
             *
             * SHUTDOWN             - Netflix is exited when the device is shut down or rebooted.
             *
             * UNKNOWN_EXIT         - Used when a partner device has no way to determine what
             *                        caused the Netflix application to terminate.
             *
             * TESTING              - Use during testing, if necessary, to avoid polluting the data.
             *                        Never use in production.
